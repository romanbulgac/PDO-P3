<ul data-spread="false">
<li>
<p>The Space Race: The mid-20th century saw the United States and the Soviet Union competing to achieve significant space milestones. The launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957 marked the first artificial satellite in orbit, followed by Yuri Gagarin becoming the first human in space in 1961.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Moon Landing: In 1969, NASA's Apollo 11 mission successfully landed humans on the Moon. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took historic steps, proving that space travel beyond Earth was possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>International Collaboration: The establishment of the International Space Station (ISS) in the late 1990s highlighted global cooperation in space research. Scientists from multiple nations conduct experiments that benefit both space exploration and life on Earth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commercial Space Travel: In recent years, private companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic have entered the space industry, making commercial space travel a reality and paving the way for future missions to the Moon and Mars.</p>
